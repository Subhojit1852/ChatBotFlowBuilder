ðŸ’¬ Chatbot Flow Design Note:

- The builder supports two node types:
  - Message: for static messages between any participants
  - User Input: for interactive steps or branching points

- In many real-world cases (e.g., WhatsApp bots), a conversation flow can be built using only Message nodes.

- If interactivity or bot-driven logic is introduced, User Input nodes are available to enrich the flow with context.

â†’ This allows the builder to scale from simple message flows to advanced chatbot decision trees.
